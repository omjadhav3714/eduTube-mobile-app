hello friends and welcome to geeks forgeeks in this tutorial we will learn howto reverse a stack using recursion sohere is the problem we have to reverse astack and we are not allowed to useloops like while four etc we can usefunctions of stacks like is empty pushand pop the idea of the solution is tohold all the values and function callstack until the start becomes empty whenthe start becomes empty we insert allthe hell values one by one at the bottomof the start let us now look at how itworkslet us assume our stag as 1 2 3 4 with 1at top we pop all the values 1 by 1 andhold all of them in function call stackuntil this side becomes empty so here wego we pop all the values until the sidebecomes empty so a function called stagin order is 4 3 2 and 1since the stack is empty now we need toinsert all the hello elements one by oneat the bottom of stack now how to insertelements at the bottom of stack to do sowe first pop all the elements and holdtheir values in function call stackuntil the start is empty then we pushthe element that was supposed to beinserted at the bottom and then we pushall the elements back let's see how itworkssince the stack is empty now we push thefirst element and function called stackthat is 4 so the stack now becomes 4 I'dtalk now we need to insert 3 at the endaccording to the algorithm we pop theentire stack and hold its value in thefunction called stack then we push theelement to be inserted at the end so wepop 4 and push 3 that is the nextelement in the function call stack so astack becomes 3 at top now we push backall the elements and function calledstack that is element which just poppedso we push fourso our staff becomes 4 3 with 4 at thetop now we need to insert the next heldvalue in the function call such that isto putting to the algorithm we need topop 4 and 3 and then push 2 at the topnow we will push back the elements wejust popped so our stack becomes 4 3 2similarly we insert 1 and we can clearlysee that the stack of the worst let usnow look at the implementation this codehas been taken from geeks for geekswebsite the function reverse reversesthe stack in this function if the stackis not empty we hold all the items inthe function called stack until we reachthe end of stack then we insert allthese items one by one at the bottom ofstack using insert add bottom functionthe function insert at bottom insert anelement at the bottom of stack if thestack is empty we push the element atthe top else we pop and hold all thevalues in function call stack until wereach end of the sack when the startbecomes empty this statement againbecomes foo and the element is insertedthen we push back all the elements thatwe just popped that is the elements heldin the function call stack that's it forthis tutorial thank you for watchingplease leave as she likes and comments
